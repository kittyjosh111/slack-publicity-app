# Adapted from the templates found at https://pypi.org/project/slack-bolt/
"""
1. EM posts up a flyer, or does a classroom announcement, or Ed discussion, etc.
2. EM takes a photo / screenshot as proof
3. EM opens up Slack/Discord on their phone, and sends the proof to a channel #publicity-points-logging
4. The Discord/Slack bot receives the proof and saves the image to a folder (named after the EM) onto a computer/server. It also renames the image to the timestamp of the submission.
5. The Discord /Slack bot responds to the user with a message confirming receipt of the proof, and optionally tells them how many photos theyâ€™ve submitted for the current event.
6. When the deadline for the event publicity is met, the bot automatically zips up all the folders of EM publicity proof and somehow sends it to the publicity officer.
7. The publicity officer then looks through all the submissions and tallies up points for EMs / updates the MasterLog.
